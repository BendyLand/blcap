00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Hi. Remember the plan? Well, throw that plan out the window and let it rot outside because plans

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,040
have changed. The edge of sleep is available right now. Not a joke. Not a drill. Not a mistake.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,480
But it's available right now through the link in the description below on Prime Video. I couldn't

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,680
say that before for reasons that I still do not fully understand. But it's out now, so I'm not

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,240
going to wait any longer because no one else is waiting for this. Or I mean, everyone else is

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,720
waiting for this because all the marketing is still set to go up on the 18th. And it is currently

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,920
the 15th, which means we have a few days where we are on our own, but the challenge is still there.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,360
So go outside, grab the plan, dust it off, and bring it back inside because we still have a job to do.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,520
Apparently. So I don't think it's going to make a difference though. I really don't. Even though

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,160
we're on our own, that's never really stopped us before. And so I think there's still plenty of

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,080
time and plenty of opportunity to make the challenge happen. If you need a reminder,

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,840
the challenge was to get it into the top 10. There's a couple of shows that are probably up there

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,160
right now. We need to dethrone them. I don't even know what they are. Whatever they are right now.

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,520
Okay, what do we got? Okay, in TV shows, you got Lord of the Rings, Rens of Power, Citadel,

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,680
Diana, Pulsa King, the legend of Vox, Machinima, lioness, killer cakes,

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,640
Reacher, the boys, Fallout, and Judy Justice. So all we got to do is beat the ever-living snot

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,240
out of that literally judge Judy. We got to beat the snot out of Judge Judy. All right, sorry.

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,840
Miss Judy Shindlin, Mrs. Judy Shindlin? Sorry, Judge Judy. You got to go.

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:44,080
We'll give it back in a little bit, but you got to go. All right, it's sorry. That's just the way it

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:51,920
is. So that's who that's our target. That's our target. Yep, Judge Judy is our target.

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,680
So I think we can beat her. I think we can beat her. And you know, all these other shows,

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,480
they haven't had a new season in a bit. And all of it doesn't matter. We just need to get into the

23
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,080
top 10. And if we go higher than that, that's great. But we are on our own. So we got to make

24
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,360
do with whatever we can. It's available right now, but you do need a prime subscription to watch it.

25
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,240
The benefit free trials. If you don't have it, you can get a free trial for it. Just be sure to

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,200
cancel it if I shouldn't say that. But you know, I'm going to say it anyway. If you get a free trial,

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,520
just be sure if you can't afford the rest of it, cancel it before it's done. And if you're outside

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,080
of the US, you won't be able to watch it without a VPN. Now I don't know if that counts detrimentally

29
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,840
towards the views, but I don't really care because it's more about people watching the show. But if

30
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,240
you're outside the US, there probably is a VPN that'll work for you depending on what country you're

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,200
in. I don't know which specific one. I don't have a VPN sponsor right now. And even if I did,

32
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,360
I wouldn't know if they would be the right call for where you are. But if you want to watch it,

33
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,840
VPNs work. And there are free trials for those as well. So we're going to do whatever the

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,960
fuck it takes to make this happen because circumstances be what they may. And the plan is still the plan.

35
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,080
Even though it's been battered and dusted off, the plan is still here. And the challenge still needs

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,600
to be met. The entire future of whatever the hell I want to do rides on this. And I know they're

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,520
going to meet the damn challenge, even if we got to do it on our own, which probably was all we

38
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,120
got to do in the first place. I don't think it was malicious. I don't think that there's any

39
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,560
conspiracy about this. I think they just didn't expect you guys to find it that soon, even though

40
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,680
I kind of told you to do that. But you know, it's not a bad thing. No one made a mistake here. We

41
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,640
had a meeting earlier today that was like, well, this has never happened before. And I'm like,

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,400
yeah, well, it should have been obvious. But here we are. So they're still all going to do all the

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,880
actual traditional marketing push on the 18th, which means that we have a few days where they're

44
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,760
not expecting it. So we can catch them by surprise. Whoever they are, we're going to catch them by

45
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,200
surprise judge duty, we're going to catch her by surprise. And then fall out that that really so

46
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,720
long ago, and then the boys, and then reach her and killer cakes. What's killer cakes? I've never

47
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,960
even heard of that. Bakers with terrifying skills, competing the most frightening challenges,

48
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,640
working with top horror effects artists to create cakes. So disgusting and realistic,

49
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,920
they're nightmarish. Don't pay attention to that. I don't care if that was captivating. We got to

50
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:25,280
put that off. All right, put that to the side and get sleeping. Get your edge on, get to sleep,

51
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,600
and then watch head to sleep. Link is in the description. Spread the word about it because

52
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,320
there is going to be absolutely no marketing about this for the next few days. And I don't

53
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,920
know if that's going to hurt the momentum of everything. So we kind of got to push it as hard

54
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:46,640
as we can right now. Take off the handcuffs. Unchain thyself. Release the beast within.

55
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:53,680
Think of imagine I said something inspirational here. Imagine I said something incredibly inspirational.

56
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,240
Imagine that I was saying something that spoke directly to your soul that penetrated all these

57
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,480
shells of insecurity and incompetence and tapped into the real you that was there.

58
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,560
Imagine these words are really resonating with you. They remind you of someone,

59
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,360
maybe a parental figure that you never got close enough to. But now you're reminded of them.

60
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,840
My words are tapping into unseen memories. You know, Ratatouille, my words are doing the strawberry

61
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,200
cheese mixture. I don't care if in real life that wouldn't actually happen or even taste that good.

62
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,040
This speech that I'm giving you right now is so goddamn inspirational. You feel like you could

63
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,600
rip down a mountain. That would have been something cool that I could say. But I didn't say it.

64
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,200
This is just a hypothetical of what if I did that. So imagine that. Put yourself in that space.

65
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,520
And real hard. Sleep real good and watch the show. Link is in the description.

66
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,600
Okay. That's it. I know you're wasting time here. You could be sleep.

67
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,640
Sleep engine. You could be sleaging. Let's get our sleeve, John. Don't ever quote me ever. Fuck.
